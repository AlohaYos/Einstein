<h1>NewtonScript Extensions</h1>

<h2>Globals</h2>

<b>MakeBinaryFromString(str, sym)</b>: Generate a binary object with the given
symbol from an Unicode text. The input format is UTF-8. The format of the binary
object is UTF-8 for newt/64, but it is converted to UTF-16 when written into
a 32 bit package or streaming package, and the symbol is <tt>'string</tt>.

<p>
<b>PatchFileFromARM(ARM_Instructions, filename)</b>: This global function
is a little helper for a very specific job. The first argument is a string
with ARM assembler instructions, usually starting with <tt>org address</tt> to
define the position in the binary. The second argument is the the file path and
name of an ARM binary, usually the NewtonOS ROM file. Calling
<tt>PatchFileFromARM</tt> will assemble and link the ARM code into ARM commends
and then overwrite the code in the ROM file with the new ARM code at the
given addresses.

<p>
<b>MakeBinaryFromARM(ARM_Instructions)</b>: Create the binary part of
a <tt>BinCFunction</tt> from ARM assembly code. Here, <tt>nativeMath</tt> and
<tt>newtonScriptMath</tt> are both functions that can be called from anywhere
in a script:
<p>
<pre>
nativeMath: {
  class : 'BinCFunction,
  numArgs: 2,
  offset: 0,
  code: MakeBinaryFromARM("
    ldr r1, [r1]          @ Unref the first argument
    ldr r1, [r1]          @ Get the integer object
    mov r1, r1, lsr #2    @ convert it into an integer
    ldr r2, [r2]
    ldr r2, [r2]          @ do the same with the second arg
    mov r2, r2, lsr #2
    add r0, r1, r2        @ add both integers
    mov r0, r0, lsl #2    @ convert the result into an integer object
    mov pc, lr            @ return to the interpreter
  ")
}
// The same in Newton Script
newtonScriptMath: func(a, b) begin
  return a+b;
end
</pre>

<p>
<b>MakeBinaryFromARMFile(ARM_Assembler_Filename)</b>: Same as above, but
instead of as string with ARM instructions, this call takes a file path and
name of an ARM assembler code file.

<p>
<b>AddStepForm(theParentView, myView)</b>: This is an original NTK function.
It ensures that the parent view has a frame named "StepChildren", and then
adds <tt>myView</tt> to that frame. This is needed to ensure that a new view
will appear as a child of the parent view when an app is opened.

<p>
<b>StepDeclare(theParentView, myView, 'myView)</b>: This is an original NTK
function. It ensures that the parent view has an array named
"StepAllocateContext", and the appends <tt>myView</tt> and the symbol
<tt>'myView</tt> to the array.

<p>
<b>_STDERR_</b>:

<p>
<b>_STDOUT_</b>:

<h2>FLTK extensions</h2>

<b>fltk:message(message)</b>: Open a message dialog box.

<p>
<b>fltk:choice(message, cancel_button, ok_button, opt_button)</b>:
Open a user choice dialog box and return the selected button id.

<p>
<b>fltk:filechooser(message, pattern, filename, relative)</b>:
Open a file chooser dialog. Returns filename or NIL.

<h2>Host File Access extensions</h2>

<b>file:new()</b>: Create a frame to access files on the host machine.

<p>
<b>file:open(filename, mode)</b>: Open a file, mode is 'read|'write|'readwrite|'append.

<p>
<b>file:isOpen()</b>: Returns nil or true.

<p>
<b>file:size()</b>: Returns file size in bytes.

<p>
<b>file:read(size)</b>: Read up to size bytes and return a binary object with the data.

<p>
<b>file:write(binaryObject)</b>: Write the content of a binary object to a file.

<p>
<b>file:seek(pos, mode)</b>: Set read position, mode is 'set|'cur|'end.

<p>
<b>file:tell()</b>: Return the current read position in the file.

<p>
<b>file:close()</b>: Closes a file, returns exception or true.
